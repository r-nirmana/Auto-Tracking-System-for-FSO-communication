# Auto-Tracking-System-for-FSO-communication

This describes my first Industrial experience in Electronics and Communications Engineering domain.In this I have worked on designing an Auto tracking
system for FSO(Free Space Optical) communication.For successful transmission of optical signals, FSO communication
systems use free space as a communication channel between
transceivers that are line-of-sight (LOS).The channel can be
atmosphere, space, or vacuum, whose characteristics determine
the transmission and reception of optical signals for designing
reliable and efficient communication systems.In this intern period I have studied about FSO communication system,Worked
on designing an Auto tracking system for FSO Communication
and further desingned an Application interface for the Auto
tracking system.
